    <h3>What is CSS?</h3>
    <ol style="color:brown;">
    <li>CSS stand for Cascading Style Sheets</li><br>
    <li>CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media</li><br>
    <li> <span class="test2">CSS is not neccesary</span><span class="test"> CSS save a lot of work.</span> It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once</li><br>
    <li><span class="list">External stylesheets are stored in CSS files</span>.</li><br>
    </ol>
    <h3>CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</h3>
    <ul class="list2" style="color:brown;">
    <li>Inline - by using the style attributes inside HTML elementsl</li>
    <li>Internal - by using a style element in the head section</li>
    <li>External - by using a link element to link to an external CSS file.</li>
    <li>The most commom way to add CSS, is to keep the styles in external CSS files. However,<span class="test"> in this tutorial we will use inline and internal styles,</span> because this is easier to demonstrate, and easier for you to try it yourself.</li>
    </ul>
    <p style="color:brown;">when comparing CSS Class vs ID, the difference in that CSS class applies a sytle to multiple elements.ID, on the other hand, applies a style to one unique elements.ID is also special in that you can use a special URL to link directly to an elements and it's used by JavaScript.</p>
    <p style="color:brown;">In CSS, Selectors are used to target a sepecific elements or range of elements on a web pages.Once an element has been targeted, a style or set of style can be applied to the element.</p>
    <p style="color:brown;">There is a wide range of selectors availables.Two of the most commonly used are classs and ID.Both are used to target elements to which a style should be applied.</p>
